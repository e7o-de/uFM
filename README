This will get an actually Usable File Manager, for now just named uFM.

# Why?
Because there's none. Ok, there are a lot of them, but just crappy ones.
Either no directory tree or just single-windowed etc.
And the Linux ones don't run that well, because Apple's Quartz stuff is horrible. So ... ;)

# Build/Install
You need Python (obviosly) and from pip the packages:
- wx
